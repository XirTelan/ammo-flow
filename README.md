## About

**AMMO FLOW** is a strategy-based tower defense game created for the [Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://gamedevjs.com/).

We’ve got a base to defend — but there’s a twist.  
The turrets? They’re already in place.  
No building, no selling, no upgrades.

You control the ammo!  
Pick what’s produced, balance your supply, and decide what gets loaded or unloaded to survive the enemy waves.

## How It Works

  - Choose an ammo type to produce at each factory.  
  - Assign workers to increase output.  
  - Ammo is automatically sent to storage.

- **Storage:**  
  - Manage your available ammo.  
  - Load turrets with the right ammo at the right time.

- **Turrets:**

  - Machine Gun: Versatile and flexible.
  - Artillery: Long-range, high-damage splash attacks.
  - Flak Cannon: Specialized for air units.
  - Railgun: Massive damage, long reloads.
  - Plasma Cannon: Continuous beam that clears lines of enemies.

  - Light, Medium, Heavy, Air, and Artillery units.  
  - Each with different health, speed, armor, and attack range.

## Quick Tips

- You gain **one worker** after each wave — assign them wisely!
- Unload and reload turrets as needed to adapt to enemy types.
- Managing your ammo balance is key to survival.
